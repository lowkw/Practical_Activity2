Business needs a customer search app. As a junior programmer, you are required to develop a Java program using a collection data structure that offers customers sort and search options.
o Define Customer class:
 The Customer class has 4 private fields: id, name, email and mobile.
o The program has 5 Customer objects in a collection object. Use ArrayList class.
o The program initially shows the original (unsorted) customers’ information.
o The program offers customers sort and search options.
 For sorting, customers are sorted by customer’s ID in ascending order. The Collections.sort() method must be used.
 For searching, the customer’s id is provided by the user. If the id is found, the customer’s info is shown. If the is id not found, an appropriate message will be displayed.
o Identify possible runtime errors, and improve program stability by using exception-handling techniques.
o Save your file as CustomerSortAndSearch.java.
